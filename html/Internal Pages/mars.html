                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the
                        Solar System, being larger than only Mars. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of
                        war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet". The latter refers to the effect of the iron
                        oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance (as shown), that is
                        distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is a terrestrial planet
                        with a thin atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and
                        the valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.<br>

                        The days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational period as well as
                        the tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are similar. Mars is the site of
                        Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System,
                        and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis
                        basin in the Northern Hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature.
                        Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be
                        captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.<br><br>

                <div class="mainParag">
                    <h1>Internal Structure</h1>
                    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        Like Earth, Mars has differentiated into a dense metallic core overlaid by less dense
                        materials. Current models of its interior imply a core consisting primarily of iron and
                        nickel with about 16–17% sulfur. This iron(II) sulfide core is thought to be twice as rich
                        in lighter elements as Earth's. The core is surrounded by a silicate mantle that formed many
                        of the tectonic and volcanic features on the planet, but it appears to be dormant. Besides
                        silicon and oxygen, the most abundant elements in the Martian crust are iron, magnesium,
                        aluminium, calcium, and potassium. The average thickness of the planet's crust is about 50
                        kilometres (31 mi), with a maximum thickness of 125 kilometres (78 mi). Earth's crust
                        averages 40 kilometres (25 mi).<br><br>

                        Mars is seismically active, with InSight recording over 450 marsquakes and related events in
                        2019. In 2021 it was reported that based on eleven low-frequency Marsquakes detected by
                        the InSight lander the core of Mars is indeed liquid and has a radius of about 1830±40 km and a
                        temperature around 1900–2000 K. The Martian core radius is more than half the radius of Mars and
                        about half the size of the Earth's core. This is somewhat larger than models predicted,
                        suggesting that the core contains some amount of lighter elements like oxygen and hydrogen in
                        addition to the iron–nickel alloy and about 15% of sulfur.<br><br>

                        The core of Mars is overlain by the rocky mantle, which, however, does not seem to have a layer
                        analogous to the Earth's lower mantle. The martial mantle appears to be solid down to the depth
                        of about 500 km, where the low-velocity zone (partially melted asthenosphere) begins. Below
                        the asthenosphere the velocity of seismic waves starts to grow again and at the depth of about
                        1050 km there lies the boundary of the transition zone. At the surface of Mars there lies a
                        crust with the average thickness of about 24–72 km.<br><br>

                        <h2>Surface geology</h2>
                        Main article: Geology of Mars
                        Mars is a terrestrial planet whose surface consists of minerals containing silicon and oxygen,
                        metals, and other elements that typically make up rock. The Martian surface is primarily
                        composed of tholeiitic basalt, although parts are more silica-rich than typical basalt and
                        may be similar to andesitic rocks on Earth, or silica glass. Regions of low albedo suggest
                        concentrations of plagioclase feldspar, with northern low albedo regions displaying higher than
                        normal concentrations of sheet silicates and high-silicon glass. Parts of the southern highlands
                        include detectable amounts of high-calcium pyroxenes. Localized concentrations of hematite and
                        olivine have been found. Much of the surface is deeply covered by finely grained iron(III)
                        oxide dust.<br><br>


                        <h2>Geologic map of Mars (USGS, 2014)</h2>
                        Although Mars has no evidence of a structured global magnetic field, observations show that
                        parts of the planet's crust have been magnetized, suggesting that alternating polarity reversals
                        of its dipole field have occurred in the past. This paleomagnetism of magnetically susceptible
                        minerals is similar to the alternating bands found on Earth's ocean floors. One theory,
                        published in 1999 and re-examined in October 2005 (with the help of the Mars Global Surveyor),
                        is that these bands suggest plate tectonic activity on Mars four billion years ago, before the
                        planetary dynamo ceased to function and the planet's magnetic field faded.<br><br>

                        It is thought that, during the Solar System's formation, Mars was created as the result of a
                        stochastic process of run-away accretion of material from the protoplanetary disk that orbited
                        the Sun. Mars has many distinctive chemical features caused by its position in the Solar System.
                        Elements with comparatively low boiling points, such as chlorine, phosphorus, and sulphur, are
                        much more common on Mars than Earth; these elements were probably pushed outward by the young
                        Sun's energetic solar wind.<br><br>

                        After the formation of the planets, all were subjected to the so-called "Late Heavy
                        Bombardment". About 60% of the surface of Mars shows a record of impacts from that
                        era, whereas much of the remaining surface is probably underlain by immense impact
                        basins caused by those events. There is evidence of an enormous impact basin in the Northern
                        Hemisphere of Mars, spanning 10,600 by 8,500 kilometres (6,600 by 5,300 mi), or roughly four
                        times the size of the Moon's South Pole – Aitken basin, the largest impact basin yet
                        discovered.[20][21] This theory suggests that Mars was struck by a Pluto-sized body about four
                        billion years ago. The event, thought to be the cause of the Martian hemispheric dichotomy,
                        created the smooth Borealis basin that covers 40% of the planet.<br><br>


                        <h3> <i>Artist's impression of how Mars may have looked four billion years ago
                        The geological history of Mars can be split into many periods, but the following are the three
                        primary periods:</i></h3><br>

                        Noachian period (named after Noachis Terra): Formation of the oldest extant surfaces of Mars,
                        4.5 to 3.5 billion years ago. Noachian age surfaces are scarred by many large impact craters.
                        The Tharsis bulge, a volcanic upland, is thought to have formed during this period, with
                        extensive flooding by liquid water late in the period.
                        Hesperian period (named after Hesperia Planum): 3.5 to between 3.3 and 2.9 billion years ago.
                        The Hesperian period is marked by the formation of extensive lava plains.
                        Amazonian period (named after Amazonis Planitia): between 3.3 and 2.9 billion years ago to the
                        present. Amazonian regions have few meteorite impact craters but are otherwise quite varied.
                        Olympus Mons formed during this period, with lava flows elsewhere on Mars.
                        Geological activity is still taking place on Mars. The Athabasca Valles is home to sheet-like
                        lava flows created about 200 Mya. Water flows in the grabens called the Cerberus Fossae occurred
                        less than 20 Mya, indicating equally recent volcanic intrusions. On 19 February 2008, images
                        from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter showed evidence of an avalanche from a 700-metre-high
                        (2,300 ft) cliff.</p>
