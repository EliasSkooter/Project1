                <h1> Here's why....</h1>

                <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        The International Astronomical Union (IAU) downgraded the status of Pluto to that of a dwarf
                        planet because it did not meet the three criteria the IAU uses to define a full-sized planet.
                        Essentially Pluto meets all the criteria except one—it <i>has not cleared its neighboring region
                            of other objects.</i></b><br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 2006 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) downgraded the status of
                    Pluto to that of
                    “dwarf planet.” This means that from now on only the rocky worlds of the inner Solar System and the
                    gas giants of the outer system will be designated as planets. The “inner Solar System” is the region
                    of space that is smaller than the radius of Jupiter’s orbit around the sun. It contains the asteroid
                    belt as well as the terrestrial planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. The “gas giants” of course
                    are Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and Uranus. So now we have eight planets instead of the nine we used
                    to have.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="partFour">
                <h1>What is a Dwarf Planet?</h1>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A “dwarf planet,” as defined by the IAU, is a celestial body in direct orbit of
                    the
                    Sun that is massive enough that its shape is controlled by gravitational forces rather than
                    mechanical
                    forces (and is thus ellipsoid in shape), but has not cleared its neighboring region of other
                    objects.
                    <br><br>

                    So, the three criteria of the IAU for a full-sized planet are:<br>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        It is in orbit around the Sun.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        It has sufficient mass to assume hydrostatic equilibrium (a nearly round shape).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        It has “cleared the neighborhood” around its orbit.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pluto meets only two of these criteria, losing out on the third. In all the billions
                of years it has
                lived there, it has not managed to clear its neighborhood. You may wonder what that means, “not clearing
                its neighboring region of other objects?” Sounds like a minesweeper in space! This means that the planet
                has become gravitationally dominant — there are no other bodies of comparable size other than its own
                satellites or those otherwise under its gravitational influence, in its vicinity in space.<br><br>

                <b>So any large body that does not meet these criteria is now classed as a “dwarf planet,” and that
                    includes Pluto, which shares its orbital neighborhood with Kuiper belt objects such as the
                    plutinos.</b><br>

                <h1>Internal structure</h1>
                <p>
                    Pluto's density is 1.860±0.013 g/cm3. Because the decay of radioactive elements would eventually
                    heat
                    the ices enough for the rock to separate from them, scientists expect that Pluto's internal
                    structure is
                    differentiated, with the rocky material having settled into a dense core surrounded by a mantle of
                    water
                    ice. The pre–New Horizons estimate for the diameter of the core is 1700 km, 70% of Pluto's
                    diameter. Pluto has no magnetic field.<br><br>

                    It is possible that such heating continues today, creating a subsurface ocean of liquid water 100 to
                    180
                    km thick at the core–mantle boundary. In September 2016, scientists at Brown
                    University
                    simulated the impact thought to have formed Sputnik Planitia, and showed that it might have been the
                    result of liquid water upwelling from below after the collision, implying the existence of a
                    subsurface
                    ocean at least 100 km deep. In June 2020, astronomers reported evidence that Pluto may have had
                    a
                    subsurface ocean, and consequently may have been habitable, when it was first formed.</p>
