                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar
                        System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times
                        that of Earth. It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its
                        larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive. Saturn is named after the Roman
                        god of wealth and agriculture. Its astronomical symbol (♄) has been traced back to the Greek
                        Oxyrhynchus Papyri, where it can be seen to be a Greek kappa-rho with a cross-bar, as an
                        abbreviation for Κρονος (Cronos), the Greek name for the planet. It later came to look like
                        a lower-case Greek eta, with the cross added at the top in the 16th century.<br><br>

                        The Romans named the seventh day of the week Saturday, Sāturni diēs ("Saturn's Day") for the
                        planet Saturn.<br>

                        Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen
                        compounds). Its core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer
                        of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale
                        yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the
                        metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is
                        weaker than the Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's
                        larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The
                        outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can
                        appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph; 500 m/s), higher than on Jupiter
                        but not as high as on Neptune.<br><br>

                        The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring system, which is composed mostly of ice
                        particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 82 moons are known to
                        orbit Saturn, of which 53 are officially named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets
                        in its rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the second largest in the Solar System, is larger
                        than the planet Mercury, although less massive, and is the only moon in the Solar System to have
                        a substantial atmosphere.<br><br>

                <div class="mainParag">
                    <h1>Internal Structure</h1>
                    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn's mass is not
                        in the gas phase, because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above 0.01
                        g/cm3, which is reached at a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass. The temperature,
                        pressure, and density inside Saturn all rise steadily toward the core, which causes hydrogen to
                        be a metal in the deeper layers.<br><br>

                        Standard planetary models suggest that the interior of Saturn is similar to that of Jupiter,
                        having a small rocky core surrounded by hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of various
                        volatiles. This core is similar in composition to Earth, but is more dense. The examination
                        of Saturn's gravitational moment, in combination with physical models of the interior, has
                        allowed constraints to be placed on the mass of Saturn's core. In 2004, scientists estimated
                        that the core must be 9–22 times the mass of Earth, which corresponds to a diameter of
                        about 25,000 km. However, measurements of Saturn's rings suggest a much more diffuse core
                        with a mass equal to about 17 Earths and a radius equal to around 60% of Saturn's entire
                        radius. This is surrounded by a thicker liquid metallic hydrogen layer, followed by a liquid
                        layer of helium-saturated molecular hydrogen that gradually transitions to a gas with increasing
                        altitude. The outermost layer spans 1,000 km and consists of gas.<br><br>

                        Saturn has a hot interior, reaching 11,700 °C at its core, and radiates 2.5 times more energy
                        into space than it receives from the Sun. Jupiter's thermal energy is generated by the
                        Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism of slow gravitational compression, but such a process alone may not
                        be sufficient to explain heat production for Saturn, because it is less massive. An alternative
                        or additional mechanism may be generation of heat through the "raining out" of droplets of
                        helium deep in Saturn's interior. As the droplets descend through the lower-density hydrogen,
                        the process releases heat by friction and leaves Saturn's outer layers depleted of
                        helium. These descending droplets may have accumulated into a helium shell surrounding
                        the core. Rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur within Saturn, as well as in
                        Jupiter and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.</p>

                    <h1>Atmosphere</h1>
                    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outer atmosphere of Saturn contains 96.3% molecular hydrogen and 3.25%
                        helium by volume. The proportion of helium is significantly deficient compared to the
                        abundance of this element in the Sun. The quantity of elements heavier than helium
                        (metallicity) is not known precisely, but the proportions are assumed to match the primordial
                        abundances from the formation of the Solar System. The total mass of these heavier elements is
                        estimated to be 19–31 times the mass of the Earth, with a significant fraction located in
                        Saturn's core region.<br><br>

                        Trace amounts of ammonia, acetylene, ethane, propane, phosphine, and methane have been detected
                        in Saturn's atmosphere. The upper clouds are composed of ammonia crystals, while the
                        lower level clouds appear to consist of either ammonium hydrosulfide (NH
                        4SH) or water. Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun causes methane photolysis in the upper
                        atmosphere, leading to a series of hydrocarbon chemical reactions with the resulting products
                        being carried downward by eddies and diffusion. This photochemical cycle is modulated by
                        Saturn's annual seasonal cycle.<br><br>

                    <h2>Cloud layers</h2>

                    Saturn's atmosphere exhibits a banded pattern similar to Jupiter's, but Saturn's bands are much
                    fainter and are much wider near the equator. The nomenclature used to describe these bands is
                    the same as on Jupiter. Saturn's finer cloud patterns were not observed until the flybys of the
                    Voyager spacecraft during the 1980s. Since then, Earth-based telescopy has improved to the point
                    where regular observations can be made.<br><br>

                    The composition of the clouds varies with depth and increasing pressure. In the upper cloud
                    layers, with the temperature in the range 100–160 K and pressures extending between 0.5–2 bar,
                    the clouds consist of ammonia ice. Water ice clouds begin at a level where the pressure is about
                    2.5 bar and extend down to 9.5 bar, where temperatures range from 185 to 270 K. Intermixed in
                    this layer is a band of ammonium hydrosulfide ice, lying in the pressure range 3–6 bar with
                    temperatures of 190–235 K. Finally, the lower layers, where pressures are between 10 and 20 bar
                    and temperatures are 270–330 K, contains a region of water droplets with ammonia in aqueous
                    solution.<br><br>

                    Saturn's usually bland atmosphere occasionally exhibits long-lived ovals and other features
                    common on Jupiter. In 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged an enormous white cloud near
                    Saturn's equator that was not present during the Voyager encounters, and in 1994 another smaller
                    storm was observed. The 1990 storm was an example of a Great White Spot, a unique but
                    short-lived phenomenon that occurs once every Saturnian year, roughly every 30 Earth years,
                    around the time of the northern hemisphere's summer solstice. Previous Great White Spots
                    were observed in 1876, 1903, 1933 and 1960, with the 1933 storm being the most famous. If the
                    periodicity is maintained, another storm will occur in about 2020.<br><br>

                    The winds on Saturn are the second fastest among the Solar System's planets, after Neptune's.
                    Voyager data indicate peak easterly winds of 500 m/s (1,800 km/h). In images from the
                    Cassini spacecraft during 2007, Saturn's northern hemisphere displayed a bright blue hue,
                    similar to Uranus. The color was most likely caused by Rayleigh scattering. Thermography has
                    shown that Saturn's south pole has a warm polar vortex, the only known example of such a
                    phenomenon in the Solar System. Whereas temperatures on Saturn are normally −185 °C,
                    temperatures on the vortex often reach as high as −122 °C, suspected to be the warmest spot on
                    Saturn.</p>
