                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System.
                        It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in
                        the Solar System combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is
                        the third-brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus. It has
                        been observed since pre-historic times and is named after the Roman god Jupiter, the king of the
                        gods, because of its observed size.<br><br>

                        Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium constitutes one quarter of its mass and
                        one tenth of its volume. It likely has a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other
                        giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. The on-going contraction of its
                        interior generates heat greater than the amount received from the Sun. Because of its rapid
                        rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid; it has a slight but noticeable bulge
                        around the equator. The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different
                        latitudes, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result of
                        this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th
                        century, when it was first seen by telescope.<br><br>

                        Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter's
                        magnetic tail is nearly 800 million km long, covering the entire distance to Saturn's orbit.
                        Jupiter has 80 known moons and possibly many more, including the four large Galilean moons
                        discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater
                        than that of the planet Mercury.<br><br>

                        Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter, making its closest approach to the planet
                        in December 1973. Jupiter has since been explored on a number of occasions by robotic
                        spacecraft, beginning with the Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions from 1973 to 1979, and later
                        by the Galileo orbiter, which arrived at Jupiter in 1995. In 2007, Jupiter was visited by the
                        New Horizons probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to increase its speed and bend its trajectory
                        en route to Pluto. The latest probe to visit the planet, Juno, entered orbit around Jupiter in
                        July 2016. Future targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable ice-covered
                        liquid ocean of the moon Europa.<br><br>

                <div class="mainParag">
                    <h1>Orbit and Rotation</h1>
                    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jupiter is the only planet whose barycentre with the Sun lies outside the
                        volume of the Sun, though by only 7% of the Sun's radius. The average distance between Jupiter
                        and the Sun is 778 million km (about 5.2 times the average distance between Earth and the Sun,
                        or 5.2 AU) and it completes an orbit every 11.86 years. This is approximately two-fifths the
                        orbital period of Saturn, forming a near orbital resonance. The orbital plane of Jupiter is
                        inclined 1.31째 compared to Earth. Because the eccentricity of its orbit is 0.048, Jupiter is
                        slightly over 75 million km nearer the Sun at perihelion than aphelion.<br><br>

                        The axial tilt of Jupiter is relatively small, only 3.13째, so its seasons are insignificant
                        compared to those of Earth and Mars.<br>

                        Jupiter's rotation is the fastest of all the Solar System's planets, completing a rotation on
                        its axis in slightly less than ten hours; this creates an equatorial bulge easily seen through
                        an amateur telescope. The planet is an oblate spheroid, meaning that the diameter across its
                        equator is longer than the diameter measured between its poles. On Jupiter, the equatorial
                        diameter is 9,275 km (5,763 mi) longer than the polar diameter.<br><br>

                        Because Jupiter is not a solid body, its upper atmosphere undergoes differential rotation. The
                        rotation of Jupiter's polar atmosphere is about 5 minutes longer than that of the equatorial
                        atmosphere; three systems are used as frames of reference, particularly when graphing the motion
                        of atmospheric features. System I applies to latitudes from 10째 N to 10째 S; its period is the
                        planet's shortest, at 9h 50m 30.0s. System II applies at all latitudes north and south of these;
                        its period is 9h 55m 40.6s. System III was defined by radio astronomers and corresponds to the
                        rotation of the planet's magnetosphere; its period is Jupiter's official rotation.</p>

                    <h1>Atmosphere</h1>
                    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jupiter is perpetually covered with clouds composed of ammonia crystals, and
                        possibly ammonium hydrosulfide. The clouds are in the tropopause and are in bands of different
                        latitudes, known as tropical regions. These are subdivided into lighter-hued zones and darker
                        belts. The interactions of these conflicting circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence.
                        Wind speeds of 100 metres per second (360 km/h; 220 mph) are common in zonal jet streams.
                        The zones have been observed to vary in width, colour and intensity from year to year, but they
                        have remained sufficiently stable for scientists to name them.<br><br>

                        The cloud layer is about 50 km (31 mi) deep, and consists of at least two decks of clouds: a
                        thick lower deck and a thin clearer region. There may also be a thin layer of water clouds
                        underlying the ammonia layer. Supporting the presence of water clouds are the flashes of
                        lightning detected in the atmosphere of Jupiter. These electrical discharges can be up to a
                        thousand times as powerful as lightning on Earth. The water clouds are assumed to generate
                        thunderstorms in the same way as terrestrial thunderstorms, driven by the heat rising from the
                        interior. The Juno mission revealed the presence of "shallow lightning" which originates
                        from ammonia-water clouds relatively high in the atmosphere. These discharges carry
                        "mushballs" of water-ammonia slushes covered in ice, which fall deep into the atmosphere.[79]
                        Upper-atmospheric lightning has been observed in Jupiter's upper atmosphere, bright flashes of
                        light that last around 1.4 milliseconds. These are known as "elves" or "sprites" and appear blue
                        or pink due to the hydrogen.<br><br>

                        The orange and brown colours in the clouds of Jupiter are caused by upwelling compounds that
                        change colour when they are exposed to ultraviolet light from the Sun. The exact makeup remains
                        uncertain, but the substances are thought to be phosphorus, sulfur or possibly
                        hydrocarbons. These colourful compounds, known as chromophores, mix with the warmer
                        lower deck of clouds. The zones are formed when rising convection cells form crystallising
                        ammonia that masks out these lower clouds from view.<br><br>

                        Jupiter's low axial tilt means that the poles always receive less solar radiation than the
                        planet's equatorial region. Convection within the interior of the planet transports energy to
                        the poles, balancing out the temperatures at the cloud layer.</p>
