                    <h1>Introduction</h1>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the
                        Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and
                        the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its
                        near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass
                        causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. The planet orbits the Sun once every
                        164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi). It is named
                        after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, a stylised version of the god
                        Neptune's trident or the Greek letter psi.<br><br>

                        Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by
                        mathematical prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of
                        Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by
                        an unknown planet. After Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his
                        observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently
                        observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position
                        predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though
                        none of the planet's remaining 13 known moons were located telescopically until the 20th
                        century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it
                        challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew
                        by the planet on 25 August 1989; Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to visit Neptune. The
                        advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has
                        recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar.<br><br>

                        Like Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium,
                        along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, though it contains a higher proportion
                        of "ices" such as water, ammonia and methane. However, similar to Uranus, its interior is
                        primarily composed of ices and rock; Uranus and Neptune are normally considered "ice giants" to
                        emphasise this distinction. Traces of methane in the outermost regions in part account for the
                        planet's blue appearance, though an unknown component is believed to color Neptune a deeper blue
                        compared to Uranus.<br><br>

                        In contrast to the hazy, relatively featureless atmosphere of Uranus, Neptune's atmosphere has
                        active and visible weather patterns. For example, at the time of the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989,
                        the planet's southern hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot comparable to the Great Red Spot on
                        Jupiter. More recently, in 2018, a newer main dark spot and smaller dark spot were identified
                        and studied. In addition, these weather patterns are driven by the strongest sustained winds of
                        any planet in the Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100 km/h (580 m/s; 1,300
                        mph). Because of its great distance from the Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is one of the
                        coldest places in the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops approaching 55 K (−218
                        °C; −361 °F). Temperatures at the planet's centre are approximately 5,400 K (5,100 °C; 9,300
                        °F). Neptune has a faint and fragmented ring system (labelled "arcs"), which was discovered in
                        1984, then later confirmed by Voyager 2.<br><br>

                <div class="mainParag">
                    <h1>Internal Structure</h1>
                    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neptune's internal structure resembles that of Uranus. Its atmosphere forms
                        about 5 to 10% of its mass and extends perhaps 10 to 20% of the way towards the core, where it
                        reaches pressures of about 10 GPa, or about 100,000 times that of Earth's atmosphere. Increasing
                        concentrations of methane, ammonia and water are found in the lower regions of the atmosphere.


                        The internal structure of Neptune:
                        Upper atmosphere, top clouds
                        Atmosphere consisting of hydrogen, helium and methane gas
                        Mantle consisting of water, ammonia and methane ices
                        Core consisting of rock (silicates and nickel–iron)
                        The mantle is equivalent to 10 to 15 Earth masses and is rich in water, ammonia and methane. As
                        is customary in planetary science, this mixture is referred to as icy even though it is a hot,
                        dense fluid. This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a
                        water–ammonia ocean. The mantle may consist of a layer of ionic water in which the water
                        molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down superionic water
                        in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float around freely within the oxygen
                        lattice. At a depth of 7,000 km, the conditions may be such that methane decomposes into diamond
                        crystals that rain downwards like hailstones. Scientists also believe that this kind of diamond
                        rain occurs on Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. Very-high-pressure experiments at the Lawrence
                        Livermore National Laboratory suggest that the top of the mantle may be an ocean of liquid
                        carbon with floating solid 'diamonds'.

                        The core of Neptune is likely composed of iron, nickel and silicates, with an interior model
                        giving a mass about 1.2 times that of Earth. The pressure at the centre is 7 Mbar (700 GPa),
                        about twice as high as that at the centre of Earth, and the temperature may be 5,400 K.

                    <h2>Atmosphere</h2>

                    At high altitudes, Neptune's atmosphere is 80% hydrogen and 19% helium. A trace amount of methane is
                    also present. Prominent absorption bands of methane exist at wavelengths above 600 nm, in the red
                    and infrared portion of the spectrum. As with Uranus, this absorption of red light by the
                    atmospheric methane is part of what gives Neptune its blue hue, although Neptune's vivid azure
                    differs from Uranus's milder cyan. Because Neptune's atmospheric methane content is similar to that
                    of Uranus, some unknown atmospheric constituent is thought to contribute to Neptune's
                    colour.<br><br>

                    Neptune's atmosphere is subdivided into two main regions: the lower troposphere, where temperature
                    decreases with altitude, and the stratosphere, where temperature increases with altitude. The
                    boundary between the two, the tropopause, lies at a pressure of 0.1 bars (10 kPa). The stratosphere
                    then gives way to the thermosphere at a pressure lower than 10−5 to 10−4 bars (1 to 10 Pa). The
                    thermosphere gradually transitions to the exosphere.<br><br>


                    Bands of high-altitude clouds cast shadows on Neptune's lower cloud deck.
                    Models suggest that Neptune's troposphere is banded by clouds of varying compositions depending on
                    altitude. The upper-level clouds lie at pressures below one bar, where the temperature is suitable
                    for methane to condense. For pressures between one and five bars (100 and 500 kPa), clouds of
                    ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are thought to form. Above a pressure of five bars, the clouds may
                    consist of ammonia, ammonium sulfide, hydrogen sulfide and water. Deeper clouds of water ice should
                    be found at pressures of about 50 bars (5.0 MPa), where the temperature reaches 273 K (0 °C).
                    Underneath, clouds of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide may be found.<br><br>

                    High-altitude clouds on Neptune have been observed casting shadows on the opaque cloud deck below.
                    There are also high-altitude cloud bands that wrap around the planet at constant latitude. These
                    circumferential bands have widths of 50–150 km and lie about 50–110 km above the cloud deck. These
                    altitudes are in the layer where weather occurs, the troposphere. Weather does not occur in the
                    higher stratosphere or thermosphere.<br><br>

                    Neptune's spectra suggest that its lower stratosphere is hazy due to condensation of products of
                    ultraviolet photolysis of methane, such as ethane and ethyne. The stratosphere is also home to trace
                    amounts of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide. The stratosphere of Neptune is warmer than that of
                    Uranus due to the elevated concentration of hydrocarbons.<br><br>

                    For reasons that remain obscure, the planet's thermosphere is at an anomalously high temperature of
                    about 750 K. The planet is too far from the Sun for this heat to be generated by ultraviolet
                    radiation. One candidate for a heating mechanism is atmospheric interaction with ions in the
                    planet's magnetic field. Other candidates are gravity waves from the interior that dissipate in the
                    atmosphere. The thermosphere contains traces of carbon dioxide and water, which may have been
                    deposited from external sources such as meteorites and dust.<br><br>

                    <h3>Magnetosphere</h3>
                    Neptune resembles Uranus in its magnetosphere, with a magnetic field strongly tilted relative to its
                    rotational axis at 47° and offset at least 0.55 radius, or about 13,500 km from the planet's
                    physical centre. Before Voyager 2's arrival at Neptune, it was hypothesised that Uranus's tilted
                    magnetosphere was the result of its sideways rotation. In comparing the magnetic fields of the two
                    planets, scientists now think the extreme orientation may be characteristic of flows in the planets'
                    interiors. This field may be generated by convective fluid motions in a thin spherical shell of
                    electrically conducting liquids (probably a combination of ammonia, methane and water) resulting in
                    a dynamo action.<br><br>

                    The dipole component of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator of Neptune is about 14
                    microteslas (0.14 G). The dipole magnetic moment of Neptune is about 2.2 × 1017 T·m3 (14 μT·RN3,
                    where RN is the radius of Neptune). Neptune's magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes
                    relatively large contributions from non-dipolar components, including a strong quadrupole moment
                    that may exceed the dipole moment in strength. By contrast, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn have only
                    relatively small quadrupole moments, and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis. The large
                    quadrupole moment of Neptune may be the result of offset from the planet's centre and geometrical
                    constraints of the field's dynamo generator.<br><br>

                    Neptune's bow shock, where the magnetosphere begins to slow the solar wind, occurs at a distance of
                    34.9 times the radius of the planet. The magnetopause, where the pressure of the magnetosphere
                    counterbalances the solar wind, lies at a distance of 23–26.5 times the radius of Neptune. The tail
                    of the magnetosphere extends out to at least 72 times the radius of Neptune, and likely much
                    farther.<br><br></p>

                    <h1>Climate</h1>
                    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neptune's weather is characterised by extremely dynamic storm systems, with
                        winds reaching speeds of almost 600 m/s (2,200 km/h; 1,300 mph)—nearly reaching supersonic
                        flow. More typically, by tracking the motion of persistent clouds, wind speeds have been
                        shown to vary from 20 m/s in the easterly direction to 325 m/s westward.[85] At the cloud tops,
                        the prevailing winds range in speed from 400 m/s along the equator to 250 m/s at the poles.
                        Most of the winds on Neptune move in a direction opposite the planet's rotation.[86] The general
                        pattern of winds showed prograde rotation at high latitudes vs. retrograde rotation at lower
                        latitudes. The difference in flow direction is thought to be a "skin effect" and not due to any
                        deeper atmospheric processes. At 70° S latitude, a high-speed jet travels at a speed of 300
                        m/s.<br><br>

                        Neptune differs from Uranus in its typical level of meteorological activity. Voyager 2 observed
                        weather phenomena on Neptune during its 1989 flyby, but no comparable phenomena on Uranus
                        during its 1986 fly-by.<br><br>

                        The abundance of methane, ethane and acetylene at Neptune's equator is 10–100 times greater than
                        at the poles. This is interpreted as evidence for upwelling at the equator and subsidence near
                        the poles because photochemistry cannot account for the distribution without meridional
                        circulation.<br><br>

                        In 2007, it was discovered that the upper troposphere of Neptune's south pole was about 10 K
                        warmer than the rest of its atmosphere, which averages approximately 73 K (−200 °C). The
                        temperature differential is enough to let methane, which elsewhere is frozen in the troposphere,
                        escape into the stratosphere near the pole. The relative "hot spot" is due to Neptune's
                        axial tilt, which has exposed the south pole to the Sun for the last quarter of Neptune's year,
                        or roughly 40 Earth years. As Neptune slowly moves towards the opposite side of the Sun, the
                        south pole will be darkened and the north pole illuminated, causing the methane release to shift
                        to the north pole.<br><br>

                        Because of seasonal changes, the cloud bands in the southern hemisphere of Neptune have been
                        observed to increase in size and albedo. This trend was first seen in 1980 and is expected to
                        last until about 2020. The long orbital period of Neptune results in seasons lasting forty
                        years.</p>
