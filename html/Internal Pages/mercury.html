                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <h4>The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is
                        only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.</h4><br><br>

                        The Latest
                        What Are JPL's Lucky Peanuts?
                        From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when
                        viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its
                        proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system – that title belongs
                        to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.<br><br>

                        Because of Mercury's elliptical – egg-shaped – orbit, and sluggish rotation, the Sun appears to
                        rise briefly, set, and rise again from some parts of the planet's surface. The same thing
                        happens in reverse at sunset.  ~ <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/">https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/</a></p>

                    <h1>Internal Structure</h1>
                    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mercury appears to have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid,
                        iron sulfide outer core layer, a deeper liquid core layer, and a solid inner core. The planet's
                        density is the second highest in the Solar System at 5.427 g/cm3, only slightly less than
                        Earth's density of 5.515 g/cm3. If the effect of gravitational compression were to be factored
                        out from both planets, the materials of which Mercury is made would be denser than those of
                        Earth, with an uncompressed density of 5.3 g/cm3 versus Earth's 4.4 g/cm3. Mercury's density can
                        be used to infer details of its inner structure. Although Earth's high density results
                        appreciably from gravitational compression, particularly at the core, Mercury is much smaller
                        and its inner regions are not as compressed. Therefore, for it to have such a high density, its
                        core must be large and rich in iron.<br><br>

                        Geologists estimate that Mercury's core occupies about 55% of its volume; for Earth this
                        proportion is 17%. Research published in 2007 suggests that Mercury has a molten core.
                        Surrounding the core is a 500–700 km (310–430 mi) mantle consisting of silicates. Based on data
                        from the Mariner 10 mission and Earth-based observation, Mercury's crust is estimated to be 35
                        km (22 mi) thick. However, this model may be an overestimate and the crust could be 26 ± 11 km
                        (16.2 ± 6.8 mi) thick based on an Airy isostacy model. One distinctive feature of Mercury's
                        surface is the presence of numerous narrow ridges, extending up to several hundred kilometers in
                        length. It is thought that these were formed as Mercury's core and mantle cooled and contracted
                        at a time when the crust had already solidified.<br><br>

                        Mercury's core has a higher iron content than that of any other major planet in the Solar
                        System, and several theories have been proposed to explain this. The most widely accepted theory
                        is that Mercury originally had a metal–silicate ratio similar to common chondrite meteorites,
                        thought to be typical of the Solar System's rocky matter, and a mass approximately 2.25 times
                        its current mass. Early in the Solar System's history, Mercury may have been struck by a
                        planetesimal of approximately 1/6 that mass and several thousand kilometers across. The impact
                        would have stripped away much of the original crust and mantle, leaving the core behind as a
                        relatively major component. A similar process, known as the giant impact hypothesis, has been
                        proposed to explain the formation of the Moon.<br><br>

                        Alternatively, Mercury may have formed from the solar nebula before the Sun's energy output had
                        stabilized. It would initially have had twice its present mass, but as the protosun contracted,
                        temperatures near Mercury could have been between 2,500 and 3,500 K and possibly even as high as
                        10,000 K. Much of Mercury's surface rock could have been vaporized at such temperatures, forming
                        an atmosphere of "rock vapor" that could have been carried away by the solar wind.<br><br>

                        A third hypothesis proposes that the solar nebula caused drag on the particles from which
                        Mercury was accreting, which meant that lighter particles were lost from the accreting material
                        and not gathered by Mercury. Each hypothesis predicts a different surface composition, and there
                        are two space missions set to make observations. MESSENGER, which ended in 2015, found
                        higher-than-expected potassium and sulfur levels on the surface, suggesting that the giant
                        impact hypothesis and vaporization of the crust and mantle did not occur because potassium and
                        sulfur would have been driven off by the extreme heat of these events. BepiColombo, which will
                        arrive at Mercury in 2025, will make observations to test these hypotheses. The findings so far
                        would seem to favor the third hypothesis; however, further analysis of the data is needed.</p>
